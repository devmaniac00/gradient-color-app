# Quick Setup Guide

## How to Get Started

Begin by cloning this repository to your local environment. Execute the following command:

### `git clone https://github.com/CodeSculptorJS/houses-app.git`

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

### `cd houses-app`

Install all required dependencies with:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, launch the app with:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

The page automatically reloads when you make changes, and any lint errors are displayed in the console.

### `npm run build`

Build the app for production to the `build` folder. This process correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes, indicating readiness for deployment.

For more information on deployment, refer to the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run build` fails to minify

Explore the [troubleshooting guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify) for solutions if the minification process encounters issues.
